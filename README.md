## About

Go beyond web design. Get strategic. Whether you are building awareness or calling the customer to action, at Network Resilience we do more than just build and implement your website. We use our experience in marketing strategy and business development to ensure that your online presence produces a return on investment.
We are happy to work with you any way you wish. However, we strongly recommend starting with your organizational goals and business development strategy.
We feel that your website is the cornerstone of your online marketing. Once we succinctly determine a customer acquisition strategy, let us build a bespoke, mobile-friendly website for you. We will implement a customized marketing message built around your products and services. We will host it for you using Amazon's scalable and reliable web servers. We will implement Google Analytics to help measure the return on investment on your website and online promotion (i.e. your marketing campaigns). Ensure that your website properly integrates with your social network platforms. Finally we will advise you on your marketing campaigns and periodically review your marketing strategy and ensure that your entire online marketing portfolio (website, Facebook Page, etc.) is worth the time and money you invest in it.
The process is iterative. We design, implement, measure, review and redesign. After we complete a review we go right back into design. We continually advise you on your customer acquisition and provide strategies to improve your marketing.
